# Sales_Data_Analysis

The project uses Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months' worth of sales data. There are hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases included in the data, broken down by month, product type, cost, and address of purchase.

In this project I:
- Merged 12 months of data
- Cleaned the data
- Added various Business case analysis, to give an in-dept analysis of the sales data
- Got the following results by analysing the data :
    - What was the best month for sales? Hoe much was earned that month
    - What city had the highest number of sales?
    - What time should we display advertisements to maximize likelihood of customer's buying product?
    - What 2 products are most often sold together?
    - What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
